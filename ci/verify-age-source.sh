#
# PGDG names the version 1.8.0~rc0 because it builds from the GitHub tag
# PG18/v1.8.0-rc0. homelab#332 requires that the pin matches the ASF release
# before it is used. Checked 2026-11-08: the two source trees are identical
# (381 files), and the one Debian patch changes only the PGOPTIONS of the
# package's own regression tests in the Makefile.
